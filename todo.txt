Bugs:
    - Save archived task. It has lost (some, all?) week slot data

Tasks:
    - Able to delete task?

General
    - Save and reload
        - Save 10 copies, so you can always go back if you make mistake

    - Save all changes in git??????
        - file per task
        - initials subtasks time_spent date
        - local vs private tasks?

    - Export as .csv or excel or something that can be imported

    - Track against budgets
        - Per task
        - Per subtask
        - slip and gain against that
        - Estimate and revised estimate. E.g. time left when partially through a task

    - Add more code comments and logging

    - Add prompt that auto-appears on schedule
        - Brings up a form with drop downs for choosing tasks/subtasks and enter time without having to look at the
            actual large panel


    - Be able to add comments to individual tracking slots

    - Real time tracking?
        - with pause

    - Change order of tasks

Collaboration:
    - Notification of new task added
    - Assign tasks to someone(s)


    - Add manager interface over IP requests
        - push and pull tasks (so that names are consistent)

Weeks:
    - Daily breakdown for latest week
    - Able to re-show daily breakdown for older weeks

UI:
    - Generally beautify
        - Fix spacing between entries so they align with task labels
        - Add borders to visually separate tasks / weeks
    - Graphs to visualise data

    - Calendar view with bars/pies to show time against things


WIBNI:
    - Improve performance of reloading entire UI. I think this is negligible as people can archive tasks and weeks.

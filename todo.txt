Tasks:
    - Able to archive tasks (removes from display, but stores the info)
        - Add button
        - Add pop up to display list of archived tasks so you can unarchive them
    - Able to delete task?

General
    - Save and reload
        - Save 10 copies, so you can always go back if you make mistake
        - Tasks
            - Subtasks
        - First week date
        - Archived tasks
        - Archived week index
        - Per week task data

    - Add comments and logging

    - Add manager interface over IP requests
    - Add prompt that auto-appears on schedule

Weeks:
    - Able to archive weeks
        - Add buttons to increase/decrease week archive index
    - Change order of tasks

UI:
    - Generally beautify
        - Fix spacing between entries so they align with task labels
        - Add borders to visually separate tasks / weeks
    - scrollbar
        - lock task details when scrolling (so you can always see it)



WIBNI:
    - Improve performance of reloading entire UI. I think this is negligible as people can archive tasks and weeks.

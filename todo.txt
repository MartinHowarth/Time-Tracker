Tasks:
    - Able to delete task?
    - Able to hide individual subtasks

General
    - Make "add subtask" button smaller.
    - Add colours to help separate out tasks visually
    - Be able to add comments to individual tracking slots
    - Week summary to only include non-zero tasks/subtasks


    - Undo?

    - Export as .csv or excel or something that can be imported to excel?

    - Add more code comments and logging

    - Add prompt that auto-appears on schedule
        - Brings up a form with drop downs for choosing tasks/subtasks and enter time without having to look at the
            actual large panel


    - Real time tracking?
        - with pause

    - Change order of tasks

    - Button to add preset time to slot? or on right click

    - button to add slot "back in time"

Collaboration:
    - Notification of new task added
    - Assign tasks to someone(s)


    - Add manager interface over IP requests
        - push and pull tasks (so that names are consistent)


    - Save all changes in git
        - file per task
        - initials subtasks time_spent date
        - local vs private tasks?

Weeks:
    - Daily breakdown for latest week
    - Able to re-show daily breakdown for older weeks

UI:
    - Generally beautify
        - Add borders to visually separate tasks / weeks
    - Graphs to visualise data

WIBNI:
    - Improve performance of reloading entire UI. I think this is negligible as people can archive tasks and weeks.
